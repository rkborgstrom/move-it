## Project Description
Move It. A peer-to-peer web application that enables users who are in the process of moving to connect with users who own a truck and can help them out. This app will allow truck owners to set a price for the day and even help them move. It will help save money for the user that is moving, as well as allow the mover to make some extra money on the side. 

## Problem Statement
People are always looking to move and many don't want to pay a moving company or rent a U-Haul.

## How will your project solve this problem?
By connecting users who wish to move and users who own a truck depending on their location. 

## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a user, I want to see a styled landing page with a logo. 
* As a user, I want to see a button that will take me to a "find a mover" page. 
* As a user, I want to see a button that will take me to a "find a contract" page. 
* As a user, I want to see a button that will take me to a "I'm a mover page" page. 
* As a user, I want to see a button that will take me to a "I can move" page. 
* As a user, and as a mover, I want to post information about my truck and what I charge for the day.  
* As a user, and as as a mover, I want to see the location of the user moving. 
* As a user, and as a mover, I want to connect with the user moving by location.
