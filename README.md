## Project Description
8
Move It. A peer-to-peer web application that enables users who are in the process of moving to connect with users who own a truck and can help them out. This app will allow truck owners to set a price for the day and even help them move. It will help save money for the user that is moving, as well as allow the mover to make some extra money on the side.
